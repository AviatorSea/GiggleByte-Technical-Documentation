                    </p>
                    <p>Open your terminal and type:</p>

                    <h4>Your First GiggleScript 📜</h4>
                    <p>Let's write your first GiggleScript. Create a new file called helloGiggle.gb and type in the following:</p>
                    <code>
                        LOL "Hello, GiggleWorld!";
                    </code>

                    <code>
                        $ giggle run helloGiggle.gb
                    </code>

                    <h4>LOLCoding Basics 🤓</h4>
                    <p>In GiggleByte, every line of code is a joke waiting to happen! Here's a quick rundown:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>`LOL "text"`: Prints a funny text to the console.</li>
                        <li>`ROFL variable`: Loops through an array with laughter.</li>

                <header>3. Syntax Basics: The ABCs of Laughter</header>
                <article>
                    <p>In GiggleByte, we believe the foundation of every great joke—or in our case, every line of code—is its structure! We've designed the syntax to be as entertaining as it is functional. 🤓🎉
                    </p>
                    <h4>Variables: The Comedic Building Blocks 🧱</h4>
                    <p>In GiggleByte, declaring a variable is as fun as setting up a punchline! 🎤</p>
                    <code>LOL_VAR joke = "Why did the chicken cross the road?";</code>
                    <h4>Functions: The Setup and Punchline 🎭</h4>
                    <p>Functions in GiggleByte are your setup and punchline rolled into one! 🤣</p>
                    <code>
                        LOL_FUNC tellJoke(joke, punchline) {
                        LOL "Setup: " + joke;
                        LOL "Punchline: " + punchline;
                        }
                    </code>
                    <h4>Error Handling: No Booing Allowed 🚫</h4>
                    <p>In GiggleByte, we don't let errors bring us down. We laugh them off with TRY_CATCH_LAUGH! 😆</p>
                    <code>
                        TRY_CATCH_LAUGH {
                        LOL riskyJoke;
                        } CATCH (boo) {
                        LOL "Oops! Let's try another joke!";
                        }
                    </code>
                    <h4>Summary 📝</h4>
                    <p>By now, you should be familiar with the basics of GiggleByte syntax. Get ready to craft jokes that not only make you laugh but also run flawlessly as code!</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Fix: Try wrapping it in a try { } catch(laugh) { } block. If it doesn't compile, at least it’ll catch a laugh! 😂</li>

                        <li>Issue: I forgot how to call a function. 🤔</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fix: If you forgot how to call a function, just yell its name really loud. Just kidding! Review the docs, and maybe it’ll jog your memory. 📚🏃‍♂️</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Issue: My app doesn’t have enough jokes. 🙁</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fix: An app without jokes is like a pizza without cheese. Unthinkable! Check out our SnickerSnippets for some zesty one-liners. 🍕</li>
